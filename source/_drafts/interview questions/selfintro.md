during my master's degree, i did my research about digital mobile radio standard, which was still a cutting-edge standard. i designed hardware circuit diagram and made my ternimal, developed communication system on it.

from july 2007 to august 2009, i was working in air force, because i was an army-orientated student , I was demanded to join the air force after graduating.   
in my bachelor's fouth year, i joined the post-graduate exam and passed. but the air force department demanded me to first join the army and work for 2 years before continue my master's lessons.
and after my master's degree, the air force commanded me to continue work there.

I build the front part of the integrated business management system, and hybrid web app on mobile phones, later i joined in some backend development also, such as developed a test framework and some of business function.
